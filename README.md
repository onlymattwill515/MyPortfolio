# Responsive Portfolio

## Description 

This Responsive Portfolio was created to demonstrate my progress in becoming a Full Stack developer. Throughout this process I learned how to use bootstrap, and expanded on my understanding on how to manipulate content & styling using CSS.

 I intend to keep coming refreshing this site, and continue making improvements as I learn more on my journey.
